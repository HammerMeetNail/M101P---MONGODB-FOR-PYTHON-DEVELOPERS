1) FINAL: QUESTION 1

Please download the Enron email dataset enron.zip, unzip it and then restore it using mongorestore. It should restore to a collection called "messages" in a database called "enron". Note that this is an abbreviated version of the full corpus. There should be 120,477 documents after restore. 

Inspect a few of the documents to get a basic understanding of the structure. Enron was an American corporation that engaged in a widespread accounting fraud and subsequently failed. 

In this dataset, each document is an email message. Like all Email messages, there is one sender but there can be multiple recipients. 

Construct a query to calculate the number of messages sent by Andrew Fastow, CFO, to Jeff Skilling, the president. Andrew Fastow's email addess was andrew.fastow@enron.com. Jeff Skilling's email was jeff.skilling@enron.com. 

For reference, the number of email messages from Andrew Fastow to John Lavorato (john.lavorato@enron.com) was 1:

db.messages.find({'headers.From': "andrew.fastow@enron.com", 'headers.To': "jeff.skilling@enron.com"}).count()

2)FINAL: QUESTION 2

Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you will need to unwind the To list for each message. 

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of (sender, recipient) pairs. 

Which pair of people have the greatest number of messages in the dataset?:

db.messages.aggregate([{$unwind: "$headers.To"}, {$group: {"_id": {"From": "$headers.From", "To": "$headers.To"}, "Emails": {$sum: 1}}}, {$sort: {"Emails": -1}}, {$limit: 3}])
